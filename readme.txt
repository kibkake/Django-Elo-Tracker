This application is a elo tracker to track player elo rating for company/office games. This app was creating using Django for both
the frontend and backend. 

Currently we have working: 
    - user registration
    - user login
    - user password reset
    - company registration
    - creating a new game
    - recording the results of a match
    - viewing results 
    - viewing player profile

We are working on:
    - Tracking player elo changes per win/loss 
    - Leaderboard to display rankings
    - Separating games so only users of that company can view them
    - Implementing admin previleges for company admins
